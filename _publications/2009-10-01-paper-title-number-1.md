excerpt: 'This study presents empirical evidence on how inmate allocation within prisons influences post-release criminal behavior in Chile. Employing a sharp regression discontinuity design, I show that first-timers placed with peers who are more actively involved in criminal activities raises the probability of reoffending by approximately 98%. I investigate four potential channels influencing post-release behavior: job market stigma, prison facilities, peer dynamics, and the impact of peer influence on participation in rehabilitation programs. Descriptive analysis indicates that although job market stigma and prison infrastructure play minor roles, the primary findings are most likely explained by peer effects and the influence of peer dynamics on participation in rehabilitation program decisions. These results carry significant implications for policymakers and stakeholders striving to lower recidivism rates via improved strategies in prison allocation.'
